Quinta Valentina Modules is a simple package to allow the means to separate your Laravel 5 application out into modules. Each module is completely self-contained allowing the ability to simply drop a module in for use.

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code. At the moment the package is not unit tested, but is planned to be covered later down the road.

Quick Installation
------------------
Begin by installing the package through Composer.

```
composer require quintavalentina/modules
```

Once this operation is complete, simply add both the service provider and facade classes to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider

```php
Quintavalentina\Modules\ModulesServiceProvider::class,
```

#### Facade

```php
'Module' => Quintavalentina\Modules\Facades\Module::class,
```

#### Compiled File Providers Support

With the release of v1.0, register the package within your applications `compile.php` config file:

```php
'providers' => [
    Quintavalentina\Modules\ModulesServiceProvider::class
],
```

You may then specify a `compiles()` public static method within each of your modules' service provider to compile additional files provided by your modules generated by the `artisan optimize` command. These should include classes that are included on basically every request into your application.

And that's it! With your coffee in reach, start building out some awesome modules!
